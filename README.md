# Coordinates resolver

## Notes from author (quickly about changes)
Why not DDD?
Instead of using DDD I decided to keep modular approach. DDD is overkill for given requirements. I know "nothing" about purpose of this application and I have small amount of time for 1-n recruitment tasks. But how could it look in DDD? Well... it could look similar to anemic domain approach, which is anti-pattern currently and waste of time.

#### Application layer could contain there:
- GoogleMaps and HereMaps services with GeocoderInterface
- Command/Query/Handler directories
#### Domain Layer could contain:
- ResolvedAddressRepositoryInterface
- Entity
- ValueObjects
#### Infrastructure Layer could contain:
- Factories
- Service implementations
- Resolved address repository
#### UI layer could contain:
- only single action controller
  In this approach I would consider using adapter pattern.

And thatâ€™s it about DDD.

## Next section is about improvements and changes.
- Php updated to 8.2, I like to keep things updated whenever it is possible. I also like features introduces in 8 like union types, named arguments, constructor property promotion, match expression.
- Symfony updated to 6.2. Consider upgrading it in main repository.
- Changed cache mechanism to use symfony build in mechanism. Of course for serious project I would rather use redis instead of apcu but in this case less is more. PLEASE do not use mysql as cache, in large environments you could kill your application :/ In your case you should use proxy or other mechanisms that satisfies your needs.
- Used CQRS pattern (only Query for sake of this task).
- Used Sync and Async messages separately (just fyi).
- Added cs-fixer and code coverage packages.
- Used composite pattern for geocoder.
- Used proxy pattern for accessing slow storage only when it is necessary.
- Currently, GeocoderInterface has alias for GeoCoderProxy. You can easily adjust this to your needs.

## This section is about things I decided to skip.
- Add more code coverage. I think that 100% code coverage is not necessary. I prefer to have 100% coverage for critical parts of application. In this case I would add more tests for services and repositories.

Code coverage summary:                 
  Classes: 44.44% (8/18)  
  Methods: 68.00% (34/50)
  Lines:   53.89% (97/180)
```
- ci/cd
- logging elk or similar
- swagger documentation
- performance monitoring (blackfire or similar)
- authorization
- handling http exceptions
- you can consider using MyIsam instead of InnoDB for performance reasons

## How to start project

These are following steps to setup project:

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

then inside of .env file, replace set correct values for GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY and HEREMAPS_GEOCODING_API_KEY variables, and those keys will be sent separately in the email. 

then prepare docker environment:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run php bash
```

final project steps inside of docker container:
```
composer install
bin/console doctrine:database:create
bin/console doctrine:schema:create
```

tests:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

then go to `http://localhost/coordinates` and it should return 

```
{"lat":55.90742079144914,"lng":21.135541627577837}
```

JSON. If you want to check different address, then add params to url: http://localhost/coordinates?countryCode=lithuania&city=vilnius&street=gedimino+9&postcode=12345 .
